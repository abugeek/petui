# Pet UI

I have learned a lot of new things from this project. Such as how to efficently work with Rows and Columns to structure beautiful UI, how to use Transform widget and work with Animations.

Huge Thanks to YouTube channel "The Growing Developer"

## Known bugs!

I don't recommend open this project on landscape mode or devices with large screens ðŸ™ˆðŸ™Š

* Some overflow things(cuz when I was developed this app I worked with small screen emulator and when I tested it on real device I realized that it has problems with responsivnes)
